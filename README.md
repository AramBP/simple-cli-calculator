## Command Line Calculator
This project showcases a simple command line calculator that solves math problems.

## How it works
Based on "calculator.pdf" inside the project directory

**Lexical analysis** and **Syntatic analysis** is done by the *Parser* component, then\
**Descent parsing** and **RPN sorting** is handled by the *Sorter* component, finally\
an **Expression tree** is generated by the *Planter* component

## Supported functions, expressions and constants
  - cos(x) ; cosine function (radians)
  - sin(x) ; sine function (radians)
  - tan(x) ; tangent function (radians)
  - e      ; euler's number
  - pi     ; pi constant
  - sqrt(n); square root function
  - log(x) ; logarithmic function
  - ln(x)  ; natural logarithm
